# CheckerDistance

This Python Script was created to utilize a circle object of a known diameter (a US Quarter is used for my example) and measure the distance of a checker on a table. The script requires the known diameter of the circular object to obtain the correct pixel/in ratio. This was created because my group needed a more accurate measuring device and by utilizing an Iphone 8's high megapixel camera and photo quality accurate measurements could be attained. This automated the measurement process improving the speed at which we captured data as well as removed human errors. Measurements could be made down to roughly ~0.0005 inches in my usage but higher precision is possible I would assume.

The cv2.Canny value needs to be adjusted depending on the quality of the photos, shadows and lighting of the photos.
